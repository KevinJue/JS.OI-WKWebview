This is an skeleton Xcode project using WKWebView in iOS 8 including interaction/communication between JavaScript and native iOS with a UIWebView fallback for earlier versions of iOS. 
Here we have a protocol that unifies the functionality we'd like to have in a WebView, design pattern and some useful functionnality to start a project.
Divided in two class (WKWebView / UiWebView), these are used in the ViewController viewDidLoad method to create a web view.

Note: JS.OI is a personnal project currently under development in spare time. it will include features in future. Dont be shy and share idea.
